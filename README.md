# Optomechanics

Python toolbox implementation of QET(Quantum Estimation Theory) for a driven dissipative optomechanical system. Theoretical discussion and foundation for the code can be found in the paper:

Features:

-Finds average position, momentum, of light and matter in the system.
-Finds steady state covariance matrix for specific or ranges of g0 and g2, in addition to epsilon, given some model parameters.
-Finds QFI matrix for specific or range of epsilon, again given some model parameters.

Ver = Python3.7

Dependencies: Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib(for easy plotting)
